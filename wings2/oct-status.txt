I am working in TCS as a I.T.Analyst C2 Grade 8 years exp Java developer and 
i aspired for Wings 2 “Engineer - Microservices” role current role is developer
Answer is :- I completed wings 2 and i received a total hike of 1,15,000 INR for all power plays
(and for PP1 i received around 46,092 INR ) 
Earlier package 14.15LPA
Now wings 2 incentive is 1.15Lakhs (i wasted my 2 years for this 1 lakh rupee which is same as my annual hike All my expectations were shattered after seeing this bullshit hike)
simple reason why i am calling this as a waste program for me ?
people who didn't do even single course they also will get 8% hike and people who invested they 2 years for completing all courses by completing all certifications they also get same hike, so what is the use of completing all courses if amount is same? instead we can stay silent right?????????

In my point of view its time waste program, because of following reasons
1) i used to complete all these ievolve courses even on saturdays and sunday without going outside
2) literally i begged TD spoc for enrolling me for PP1 edureka certifications, i escalated TD spoc as they didnt notify me reg certifications, how much of time i waited after clicking notify button in ievolve
3) 2 years i struggled to improve t-factor and to loyally complete all these course and hacker ranks

These are only technical courses alone
There are around 100+ udemy, linked in courses for pp2,pp3 and to complete pp3 mettle exam we should write many assessments and we should attend articulation sessions in based ODC locations

After investing this amount this wings2 incentive is same as my annual hike
The worst thing is people who completed 

My experience :- for this lolipop increment i invested 2 years, this increment is not at all worth , and they is very very far less than what i expected, 
If u decided to stay in tcs forever then only do it 
 
My dear colleagues:-  Take away is first ask and know how much hike will be given for your aspired role, know that before starting your wings2  journey, and think if that great amount is really worth for you or not, based on that enroll
