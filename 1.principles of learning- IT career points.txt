5 whys principle - if u ask 5 whys for same question - u will get full knowledge

once a risk is identified, you should have proper controls
ex:- i watch movies more, you should have controls like note down in excel file how many movies you watched in this month

how to learn all concepts
=========================
always plan the day, 
what u are going to learn tomm - plan it 
1) Daily you have to learn a bit - onsite anil is learning na daily, so we should also learn
2) punctuality
3) always Read source code, read documents, read books, udemy course, read in internet misc sites, YouTube videos , Donâ€™t study for interview, study for the survival of the job
4) always be up to date, somehow luckily i am able to crack ameriprise interview with old proj knowledge,  other failed only
- so that why be upd to date,
  - nobody knows when onsite comes, if onsite requires front end , by that time u should be ready - so learn java and relateed tech fully

5) while learning read  the documentation of a class


caution
--------------------
---> if u invest time to learn concepts - everything will be easy - because we are not creating anything, we are just learning
--> if u dont know even system.out.println() also will be difficult


read books in windows
-------
best app to read in windows is aquile reader

love what u learn
----------------
1) love the technology and learn - and embrace by learning that- like react auto re-render using class component
how much they would have struggled to invent that technology like - JDBC / mongo change streams / react auto -re-render 





THink negatively - what if we change default application.properties file name to santu.properties file (will it recognize? if yes how ?)
Extend the functionality and think or
Think in more scenarios

1) always read documentation - which will have all concepts, trainer may miss some concepts, but in docs every thing will be there


your behaviour
1) u have to be proactive instead of reactive 
5) proactive people plan daily agendas
2) you have to anticipate the problem before it arises
3) always predict and prevent
4) have clear goals and vision & set milestones
5) set milestones and evaluates progress against that
6) consult with a friend who already done it

Behaviour and character
============================
1) Diversity - people are from diverse locations.., 
show Equity- respect them equally based on their needs -
show inclusion - if you cant come to park , to include others change the location
show inclusion in workspace-  if someone goes to pickup her child , change the meeting time so that she will also attend daily
inclusion is pre-requisite for the functioning of a diverse workforce
	Creating an inclusive environment at work essentially means, treating every employee fairly, specifically basis their needs, respectfully and equally. An inclusive individual ensures awareness around his/her personal bias stereotypes and preferences to make sure that their behaviors are consistently inclusive. 
2) Respecting every individual for their uniqueness - Be respectful, Be sensitive
show respect to everyone encourage individuals to share their thoughts
3) there should not be any Conscious / Unconscious Bias between men and women - no gender bias/ no location bias
Bias- this is the tendency to prefer one person /one thing
Unconscious Bias has a negative impact at the workplace  as it leads to favouritism, groupism, projection of personal beliefs, likes and dislikes and irrational behaviour.
No gender bias- we should provide fair and equal oppurtunity with everyone
 The team needs to understand that all diverse identities need to be respected and there will be zero tolerance towards discrimination of any kind.
4) Listen- listen to others, be open to new ideas

how to solve issues easily
=============================
1) read the issue fully , all issues will be solved with what, why , how these WH keywords
in wells i got a error 401, but i gave credentials to pull , but what is missed is "i didnt read the error properly" it was --> 401 while downloading gradle 
i should have analysed as "why its downloading gradle as i already have it in my system" then issue would have solved without any other person help
