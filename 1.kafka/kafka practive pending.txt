still didnt understand what is use of setting true
================
1) auto.offset.reset=true what does it means?
i think  this will work only for un comitted offsets 
if u have already committed offsets till 500 , even if u start 10 times al
if u want to re consume the messages ha only way is dont commit the offsets

Try without comitting the offsets and if u start and stop u will consume all messages once again

2) add shut down hook for graceful shutdown
=============================================
means add some task to that. so that jvm while its going to shutdown it will execute that task
consumer graceful shut down - while shutting down u have to interrupt that consumer thread and we have to wait for that main 
3) practice consumer.poll
3) practice consumer group rebalance with graceful shut down- make 3 consumers working in same group to read from 3 partitions and let 1 consumer die with graceful shutdown and only because of graceful shutdown groups will rebalance -try without graceful shutdown will groups rebalance properly ??
check if existing 2 consumers reading from 3 partitions or not

i think even if it is graceful shutdown or not anyways consumer will join the group and shares the partition based on the rebalance partition assignment strategy it will join 
5) only for static group members will that session timeout work??? for non static group members will that work???
