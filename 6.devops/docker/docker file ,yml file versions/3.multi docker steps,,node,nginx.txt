## parent is node application which is alpine version and this is a builder phase
## builder is not fixed keyword,it can be any name
FROM node:16-alpine as builder
WORKDIR '/app'
			# once proj is built ,"build" folder also will be created here in /app/build
COPY package.json .  ##bec this is mandatory file to install node
RUN npm install  		## same like maven clean install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

## once above step is complete, all the software will be in /app/build,because 
we set the workspace to "/app" folder
FROM nginx
## this says copy from builder phase ,from builder phase copy the data from /app/build 
to "/usr/share/nginx/html" this is a fixed path , we should copy into this folder only
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
