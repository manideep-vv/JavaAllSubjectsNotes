gradle

new33

gradle projects command to see all sub / multi module projects

gradle bootRun command

build sub module alone gradle :bdd:build

parent dependencies to be applied to child then else parent dependencies may not flow to child

subprojects {

apply plugin: 'java'

if (project.hasProperty("localTests")) ( testImplementation project(':')

}

means root project

here for the current project we are adding the root project as a dependency for the testImplementation configuration.

This means that the test code in the current module can use the classes and resources from the root project.

2) problem while testing with gradle commands

gradle :bdd:test -Dcompany wellsfargo -PlocalTests

here even if u execute gradle command with gradle arguments, temporarily it will set these properties to system path but container @SpringBootTest(classes AppLauncher.class, webEnvironment SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)

is getting started these values will be erased and these value will not be considered by spring container at all
solution is give from intellij arguments
