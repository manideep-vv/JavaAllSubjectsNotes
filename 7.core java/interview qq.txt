threading related
-----------------
1) if 100 threads but single processor ? - is there any use? can we create million threads?
context switch means? thread state, deadlock, live lock , atomic variable, semaphores, mutex, 
cyclic barrier & semaphores
thread life cycle
wait() vs sleep() 
solution for producer consumer sync-  produce 1 consume 2 , produce 2 consume 2
sync block vs methods vs re entrant locks
producer consuemr problem solution 
volatile

2) ssl - what is SHA-256 secure hashing algorithm - assume we are sending the data- what is the proof that data is not tampered in between
---> in this case we should send both original and hashed data, at the end we will hash the original data and we will compare with the received hashed data 
if both hashes are same then it means - data is not tampered, 


(deep analysis – middle men will also have the public key –he can decrypt the hash with public key and then he will get the decrypted hash and he already original data- now he saw the original data and hash
But he cant tamper – bec assume he changed original data and with tampered data he generated hash but he cant sign bec he don’t have private key,
That’s why we are signing , since the middle men will not have the private key he cant sign, since he cant sign he wont tamper the data at all , hence signing is important
