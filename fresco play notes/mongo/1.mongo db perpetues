    2.4.GO to STEP 3.6
3. IF not match found in STEP 2 
3.1 Generate Candidate plan
3.2 Evaluate Candidate plan
3.3 Choose a winning plan
3.4 Create cache entry

If there are no matching entries, the query planner will generate candidate plans.

If a matching entry exists on STEP 2, the query planner will generate a plan and evaluate its performance through a replanning mechanism.

On Step 3 Onwards, query planner will choose a winning plan, and creates a cache entry containing the winning plan, and uses this to generate the result documents

Work Load Tuning can be performed by using

Database Profiling
Explain

profilers
==========
Following are some of the profiling levels that are available:

0: This is the default profiler level.
1: collects data for operations which is longer than the value of slowms.
2: collects data for all operations.
db.getProfilingLevel()
db.getProfilingStatus()
db.setProfilingLevel(2)
db.setprofilingLevel(1,25)-- sets the slow operation threshold for the mongod instance to 25 milliseconds:ie Report anything below 25 milliseconds

mongod --profile 1 --slowms 25 --slowOpSampleRate 0.1

Consider the below example. This will set profiling level to 1, define slow operations that last longer than 25 milliseconds, and specify only 10% of slow operations should get profiled
