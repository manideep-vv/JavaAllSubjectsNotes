synchronous communication :- using REST services Micro services can communicate synchronously
Asynchronous communication:-  using Message queue- like active mq  or kafka

=====When to use Asynchronous communication=========
Coupling between applications can be loosened.
===========================================
 in asynchronous messaging, the caller won't wait for the response, which is known as fire-and-forget. The architecture in asynchronous messaging is known as Event-driven architecture (EDA).
 Due to the asynchronous process, you can achieve high scalability and high availability.


 Realtime use cases of async processing
 ------------------------------------
 Let us consider a famous e-commerce website like Amazon that handles different services like order placement, invoice creation, payment processing, order fulfillment, and shipping.
Every service is handled asynchronously so that the order is accepted and acknowledged as quickly as possible



31. When to use replyTo header?
32. Use MessageId and CorrelationId Headers

33. setting message expiry 
34. accessing the expired message ;- tou can access the expired message in the another queue named expiryQueue
35. Delay the message delivery -now
36. Add custom message properties
37. Message Types
38. Message types in action
39. Create Object Message

9. Request Reply Messaging


30. Use replyTo JMS Header



about Active MQ
===========
-----once u download it from internet , you will have lot of examples to practice------
ActiveMQ is an implementation of JMS. The main purpose of JMS is to provide synchronous or asynchronous message delivery, an only-once message delivery,
 message durability and so on
 
 ActiveMQ can be integrated with different application servers like Apache Tomcat, Jetty, Apache Jeronimo, JBoss, and Java Application Server.`
  ActiveMQ will run in Java VM, but clients can be written in any language
  Broker Clustering

Multiple numbers of ActiveMQ brokers are combined to form a network for Scalability. This is defined as a network of brokers and they also support different types of topologies like Star, Bus, Ring, and Mesh.
middleware that provides asynchronous message queuing such as Ap	o on.
MOM is treated as message mediator between Sender and receiver.
Additional features are added to MOM which are not available in enterprise messaging like Message persistence, robust communication, Message transformation, and Complex message routing.
MOM also provide some commonly supported protocols such as HTTP, TCP/IP, UDP, and SSL.
It is just like an API which is used to abstract the interaction between the messaging clients and MOM's which is similar to JDBC abstracts communication with relational databases.
JMs is specificaiton and active mq is one of the implementation.

Monitoring
=============
ActiveMQ aspects can be monitored through different JMS tools like JCon-sole or Active web console.
