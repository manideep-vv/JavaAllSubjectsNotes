You can also log a security incident anonymously by going to Security Incident Reporting tool link (https://securityportal.tcs.com(opens in a new tab)). 


code:-
========
one must write code by adopting the SSA (software security assurance)
detect any unauthorized access by monitoring logs
dev should ensure logs must be caputured for all critical events


logical access
==============
implement a role based access--> like in wells fargo 
one must hold related access only, a dev should not be given with prod database access

as a delivery partner
============
BCP- business continuty plan (so we should always think about our future projects and plan prepare tech accordingly)
BCP plan must be documented earlier  and should be communitcated to customer,assco & take approval from customer and admin..
so that assoc will be prepared



personal
============
1) Never give ur credentials to others & never take others credentials
2) never give ur id card to other - 1 person gave his id card to her wife & she used to scan , finally after 1 year in audit they found out
password sharing should be strictly prohibited
3) use access/data only for intended purposes for what access has been given - since u have prod db access- we shouldnot misuse the data
accessing business information without a valid use case is a misuse of data
4) associates will be checked for criminal records- so never go wrong route - these days traffic police is filing criminal case if u go on wrong route
