Distract yourself. When you are feeling overwhelmed by sexual urges, try to find a distraction. This could be anything from reading or watching TV to going for a walk or playing a sport.
Exercise. Exercise is a great way to release pent-up energy and reduce stress, both of which can help to manage sexual feelings.
Practice relaxation techniques. Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and meditation can help to calm your mind and body.
Avoid1 triggers. If you can identify any triggers that are causing your sexual feelings, try to avoid them. This may mean avoiding certain places, people, or situations.
